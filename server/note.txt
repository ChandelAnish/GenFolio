return {updatedHeroData} // updatedHeroData is python dict

    {updatedHeroData} --> it is not a dictionary, it is a set instead.

    -> You're trying to return a set containing a dictionary (updatedHeroData appears to be a dictionary). In Python, dictionaries are mutable and therefore can't be used as elements in a set or as keys in another dictionary since they're unhashable.

    -> Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
