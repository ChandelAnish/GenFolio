Why Convert a File to a Data URL (Base64)?
    1️⃣ Direct Preview in the Browser
            - A file (like an image) is stored on the user's device, and browsers can’t display raw files directly.
            - readAsDataURL(file) converts the image into a Base64 string, which can be directly assigned to an <img> tag.
    2️⃣ No Need for a Temporary File Storage
            - Instead of uploading the file and getting a URL from the server, you generate a temporary URL using Base64.
            - This is useful for instant previews in forms before uploading.



****In Next.js App Router (app directory), API route handlers only receive req (not res).

****Whenever you return an object inside an arrow function without return, use () to enclose it.
        - In JavaScript, when using an arrow function without curly braces ({}), the function implicitly returns whatever comes after =>.
        - However, if you want to return an object, you need to wrap it in parentheses (()) because curly braces {} are interpreted as a function body, not an object.



***setProfileData((prev) => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));
        -> the square brackets around [name] are necessary in this context. This is using JavaScript's computed property name syntax, and here's why it's needed:
        -> When you write [name]: value, you're using the variable name to dynamically determine which property of the object to update.
